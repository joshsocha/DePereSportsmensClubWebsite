	<p>De Pere Sportsmen's Club offers a standard 50 foot indoor range for pistol and small bore rifle shooting.  Due to the backstop construction a maximum velocity of 800 F.P.S. must be enforced to prevent damage, and No jacketed bullets are permitted. We typically shoot .22 rimfire, and some .38 and .45 target loads only. So, no 9mm, .357, .44, and the like.  Higher velocity pistols are restricted to outdoor range use only. Check the Action Pistol link below.</p>
	<p>An indooor pistol league meets every Tuesday from September through May. NRA Conventional Pistol also known as Bullseye is the course of fire on Tuesday nights. Below are some links to tell you more about Bullseye. Open shooting is available on Tuesday nights as space permits, and there is always someone available to help you get started in this fun and challenging sport. If your interested, stop out about 7PM on Tuesday to check it out.</p>

		<p>Once you've got the right guns and loads, all you need are steely nerves, a disciplined trigger finger, and a rock-solid hold to compete in this challenging sport.</p>
		<p>Here's something new for you to try. Take a one-pound coffee can and spray paint the bottom black. Set the can on its side downrange about chest height with the bottom facing you. Now take your favorite revolver or pistol in one hand, standing up with no rest, and shoot 10 rounds at the bottom of the coffee can. If you need to, take 10 minutes. By the way, set the coffee can 50 yards away.</p>
		<p>I've just described one-third of a bullseye handgun match, also known as "conventional pistol" in official NRA terminology. Bullseye is the granddaddy of all popular handgun competition in this country. Its three-gun, 2700-point format goes back to the 1941 National Matches and has been the standard ever since for national and state championships, regional championships, and most outdoor tournaments.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Many individuals become interested in pistol competition; however, unless they start off with the proper information, they find it difficult. The cost of equipment is generally a stumbling block. Many feel that unless they have the best of everything they cannot compete. This is not true. Most start with a minimum investment of a .22 caliber rimfire pistol (autoloader or revolver), spotting scope and stand.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><b>Bullseye</b>, also known as <b>conventional pistol</b>, is a shooting sport in which participants shoot handguns at paper targets at fixed distances and time limits. A number of organizations, including the NRA and Civilian Marksmanship Program in the United States, have established rules and keep records for these sports. Emphasis is on accuracy and precision. The sport is primarily popular in United States and Canada. Bullseye pistol was the inspiration for the ISSF international 25m Standard Pistol(82 feet) event and like the ISSF pistol events, the development of skills required to shoot one-handed at 6-inch and 8-inch bullseye targets at 25 and 50 yards, respectively, takes considerable training to achieve proficiency.</p>
