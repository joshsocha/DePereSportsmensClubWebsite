	<p>De Pere Sportsmen's Club offers a standard 50-foot indoor range for pistol and small-bore rifle shooting.  Due to the backstop construction a maximum velocity of 800 F.P.S. must be enforced to prevent damage, and no jacketed bullets are permitted. We typically shoot .22 rimfire, and some .38 and .45 target loads only. So, no 9mm, .357, .44, and the like.  Higher velocity pistols are restricted to outdoor range use only. Check the Action Pistol link below.</p>
	<p>An indoor pistol league meets every Tuesday from September through May. NRA Conventional Pistol also known as Bullseye is the course of fire on Tuesday nights. Below are some links to tell you more about Bullseye. Open shooting is available on Tuesday nights as space permits, and there is always someone available to help you get started in this fun and challenging sport. If you're interested, stop out about 7PM on Tuesday to check it out.</p>
