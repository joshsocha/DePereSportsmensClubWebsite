	<p>The Action Pistol League is held at the Club grounds every Tuesday night, and you're welcome to stop out to see what we are up to. This outdoor activity evaluates a competitor's accuracy and speed while completing a timed course of fire. The league mostly follows IDPA rules and format. Experienced members are available to assist you in starting out while assuring you that safe practices are always followed. Registration and attendance at a safety clinic are required to participate in the league.</p>
