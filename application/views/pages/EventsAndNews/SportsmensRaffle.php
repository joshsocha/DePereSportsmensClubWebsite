<h1>Sportsmen's Raffle</h1>
<p>A fun evening of bucket raffles, games, food, and fellowship providing an opportunity to help support the efforts of the De Pere Sportsmen's Club. Events like the Sportsmen’s Raffle provide a chance to see lots of other members who may not participate in the shooting sport of your choice. At this writing the De Pere Sportsmen's Club has almost 650 members!! What a wonderful tribute to the Club efforts to see a significant percentage of this membership participate in this evening event each year! One of the largest Club fundraisers, this late-winter event helps to provide the resources necessary for Club growth and development. Come on out and join the fun, consider helping to operate one of the events of the evening, and bring your friends. It all helps with the promotion of the services and activities of the De Pere Sportsmen's Club. There’s truly something for everyone!!</p>
