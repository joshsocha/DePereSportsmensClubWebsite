	<!---<p>Hunting Course Requirements (<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/education/outdoorSkills/safetyEducation.html#2">From WI DNR Website</a>)</p>
	<p>Anyone born on or after Jan. 1, 1973, must have completed a hunter education course and show the certificate to purchase any hunting license in Wisconsin. However, if they will be hunting under the hunting mentorship program or they have successfully completed and have proof completing basic training in the U.S. armed forces, reserves or national guard, they do not need a hunting safety course certificate to purchase a license.</p>
	<p>Hunter education graduates receive a certificate that is accepted in every state, Canadian province and Mexico. </p>
	<p>For Wisconsin residents, a first time graduate may use the Wisconsin hunter education certificate in lieu of a small game hunting license from the date of issuance until March 31 of the following year. Those qualifying do not need to purchase a small game license, the certificate is the license for the established time period. </p>
	<p>Course information </p>
