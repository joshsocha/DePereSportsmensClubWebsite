<p><b>Volunteers are at the heart of the success of all events.</b> The Club promotes safe shooting sports, and this cannot happen without the dedication of members not only to join each year, but also to contribute time toward the care, maintenance, and operation of virtually all Club events. Consider what you might be able to do to assist in the provision of a league, join in during a maintenance day on the Club grounds, be a volunteer at Sight-In Days, or help with a fundraiser. A Club membership roster of almost 500 members speaks well of what the De Pere Sportsmen's Club has to offer. It also puts additional pressures on the facility as the result of the increased use.</p>
<p>Dues are an expression of support for the Club. Dues do not cover the cost of operation of all of the facilities or support the efforts of the Clubâ€™s mission throughout the community. The events and fundraisers are a great opportunity to further support the efforts of De Pere Sportsmen's Club.</p>
<p>Talk with a Board member if you are looking for a way to find out more. Your volunteer efforts are not only much appreciated, but the future success of the De Pere Sportsmen's Club depends on your assistance.</p>
