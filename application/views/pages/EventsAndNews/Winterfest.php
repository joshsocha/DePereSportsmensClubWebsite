The oldest and largest fundraising event of the year, Winterfest provides a wide range of events, fun, and food to help sweep away the mid-winter blahs. The festival is open to the public, and offers something for everyone. A Trout Tank for the kids is always a winner, as well as other games and activities. Chicken booyah, a northeastern Wisconsin tradition, as well as hot dogs, hamburgers, and other tasty treats are served together with your favorite refreshments.</p>
