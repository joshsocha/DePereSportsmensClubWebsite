<h1>Winterfest</h1>
<p>February of each year sees the return of Winterfest as a Club fundraiser. The oldest and largest fundraising event of the year, Winterfest provides a wide range of events, fun, and food to help sweep away the mid-winter blahs. The festival is open to the public, and offers something for everyone. A Trout Tank for the kids is always a winner, as well as other games and activities. Chicken booyah, a northeastern Wisconsin tradition, as well as hot dogs, hamburgers, and other tasty treats are served together with your favorite refreshments.</p>

<p>Members! Please talk to a board member to get some raffle tickets to sell. Proceeds are critically important in providing funds for needed Club grounds improvements and support for Club goals. Conducted entirely through volunteer support, this event helps to bring all members together to support the activities and facilities of the Club. Check the calendar in the website, and plan to be a part of this both as a participant as well as consider providing some volunteer time to add to the event’s success!</p>
