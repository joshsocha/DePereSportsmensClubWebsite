	<p>The trap facilities at De Pere Sportsmen's Club include three trap ranges against a backdrop of a hill and woods. It is not uncommon to see deer moving and grazing through the woods in the evening, even as members are shooting at clays. They just seem to know that they have nothing to fear up on the hill.</p>
	<p>Trap fields 1 and 2 are used primarily for league shooting and special events, while Trap field 3 is used for open shooting. Trap field 3 is available to shooters for practice on league nights from 6:30 to 9:00 PM. Experienced members are always available to assist new shooters in learning the game.</p>
