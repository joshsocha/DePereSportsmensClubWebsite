	<p>The Charles Gouleke Nature Area is a preserve located on the club grounds. Dedicated to the memory of Charles Gouleke, this area boasts one of the most spectacular displays of wild flowers in the state, with more than 95 different species growing in this concentrated area.</p>
	<p>This area includes some of the 3-D archery range, so it is not open to nature walks during league shooting, but is a wonderful place to shoot a few pictures, and just enjoy the quiet beaty of the forest. It is particularly beautiful in late April and Early May. Please leave only footprints, and take only pictures and memories.</p>
