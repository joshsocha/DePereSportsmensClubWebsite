	<p>Club events center around the Club House as the hub of all activities held on the Club grounds. We have amenities such as a bar, a large meeting and event room, restrooms, and a full kitchen.</p>
	<p>The meeting room wall also features the many awards and trophies earned by the Junior Rifle shooters and other Club marksmen. Take a walk around this Honor Wall while contemplating the impact the De Pere Sportsmen's Club has had in promoting safe shooting for generations past and future. A wonderful tribute to those whose time and dedication have led to each new generation of shooters developing a life-long interest through the efforts of your Club. There is always an opportunity for someone new to join the ranks of those who carry the legacy forward. Consider how you too can take a more active role in this Club effort.</p>
