	<p>Club events center around the Club House as the hub of all activities held on the Club grounds. Recent improvements have upgraded amenities such as the full bar with seating for 40 persons, a large meeting and event room, new seating, restrooms, and a full kitchen. Volunteers have assisted skilled craftsmen, who have also provided most of the work at no cost to the Club. The upgrades include beautiful new wood wall treatments to the bar area and meeting room, new cabinets and wall treatments in the indoor shooting range, and upgrades in the kitchen and bathroom facilities.</p>
	<p>The meeting room wall also features the many awards and trophies earned by the Junior Rifle shooters and other Club marksmen. Take a walk around this Honor Wall while contemplating the impact the De Pere Sportsmen's Club has had in promoting safe shooting for generations past and future. A wonderful tribute to those who’s time and dedication have led to each new generation of shooters developing a life-long interest through the efforts of your Club. There’s always an opportunity for someone new to join the ranks of those who carry the legacy forward; consider how you too can take a more active role of this Club effort.</p>
