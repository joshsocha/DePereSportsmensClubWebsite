	<p>We offer an outdoor range of 10 meters, 25, 50, and 100 yards. The rifle range is open year round to all members.For safety, you will be provided with a list of range rules and a 20 min. video that needs to be viewed prior to using the facility. Once you view the video you will be given a range badge that is to be worn on the range at all times. You will also receive the combination to the lock so you can enter at your discretion.</p>
	<p>Any member that has viewed the video can use the outdoor range. A few of these important rules are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>NEVER handle your firearm when someone is down range</li>
