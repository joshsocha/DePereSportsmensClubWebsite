	<p>Take a quick tour of the 3-D range through the photos of this part of the facility. Wandering through the verdant hills of the Club grounds, the 3-D range is challenging to shooters of all skill levels and gives the participants a walk through the home of beautiful wildflowers and mature hardwoods which surround the Club. Enjoy the shooting at a state-of-the-art range while soaking in the natural beauty of the Club grounds preserved through the voluntary efforts of the dedicated members of De Pere Sportsmen's Club. Please consider joining the ranks of the active members who help to preserve this for future generations.</p>
