	<p>De Pere Sportsmen's Club offers a standard 50-foot indoor range for pistol and small-bore rifle shooting which is available for league use only. Not all handguns are allowed due to the backstop construction. The maximum velocity for bullets is 800 FPS. No jacketed bullets are permitted either. Higher velocity pistols are restricted to outdoor range use only.</p>
	<p>An indoor pistol league meets every Tuesday from September through April. Open shooting is available on Tuesday nights as space permits, and there is always someone available to help you get started in this fun and exciting sport.</p>
