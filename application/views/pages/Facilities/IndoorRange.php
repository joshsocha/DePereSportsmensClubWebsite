	<p>De Pere Sportsmen's Club offers a standard 50 foot indoor range for pistol and small bore rifle shooting which is available for league use only. Any handgun may be used, but due to the backstop construction a maximum velocity of 800 F.P.S. must be enforced to prevent damage. No jacketed bullets are permitted. Higher velocity pistols are restricted to outdoor range use only.</p>
	<p>An indoor pistol league meets every Tuesday from September through April. Open shooting is available on Tuesday nights as space permits, and there is always someone available to help you get started in this fun and exciting sport.</p>
	<p>New to the club is an Action Pistol league, which utlizes the outdoor range. Check in with the pistol league representative for more information about getting started. More experienced members are always available to help out.</p>
