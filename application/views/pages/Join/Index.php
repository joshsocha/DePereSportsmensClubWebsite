<p>Yearly membership (May through April) to the De Pere Sportsmen's Club is $70 and includes membership for a spouse and children under 18 years of age. The membership fee is no longer prorated, and all memberships renew in May, so be sure to join early in the year to get the most BANG! for the buck.</p>
<p>A motion has been passed to increase membership fees for the 2014-2015 membership year to $70</p>
<p>In order to join the De Pere Sportsmen's Club it is required that you watch a mandatory safety video at the time you submit your membership information and pay your dues. Effective May 2012, the Rifle Range guest fee is now $10 per day, per person. All guests must be accompanied by a paid member.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is to stop out at the club any day or night there is meeting, league, or event. This will ensure that all your paperwork is in order and that you watch the safety video.
