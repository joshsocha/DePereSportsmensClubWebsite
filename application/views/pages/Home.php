        <h2>Archery</h2>
        <p>The 3D course is reopened for the spring. Targets are up and ready for arrows. Before entering the course stop by the archery board and pay your fee. <b>Crossbows are only allowed on targets 1 through 6, and NO BROADHEADS are allowed anywhere on the course.</b></p>
        <p>We are again looking for Sponsors to advertise on one of the many signs that we have by each of the 30 targets we have on the course. This will also put your name and business on the sponsor page on our club website. For only $100 a year, it is a great way to advertise your business. To sponsor a 3D target, please contact Jim S at 920-819-6616.</p>
