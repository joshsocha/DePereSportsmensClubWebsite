<h1>Who we are...</h1>
<p>Welcome to the DePere Sportsmenâ€™s Club! Established in 1952 by a group of dedicated volunteer sportsmen to further promote shooting sports in the Green Bay area, the De Pere Sportsmen's Club continues to provide opportunities for people of all ages to experience the benefits and beauty of a lovely natural surrounding while continuing to educate community members, and promote a wide range of shooting sports in a safe appropriate facility. The legacy of the founders continues today through the regular efforts of volunteers. Check in with a Board member to find out how you can help continue the legacy for future generations.</p>
<p>De Pere Sportsmen's Club offers a wide variety of leagues and annual events for you and your family, whether you are an experienced shooter, or a newbie looking for a place to learn and experience shooting sports. Do you have a son or daughter who would like to learn how to shoot? There are always experienced shooters both available and willing to help you with the basics, and steer you or your child into another Club opportunity. Emphasis is always placed on safety first to establish safe gun and bow handling habits. The De Pere Sportsmen's Club really takes an active interest in getting shooters started off right, and including them in the activities of the Club. De Pere Sportsmen's Club is proud of their collective role in bringing these fun sports to new generations of enthusiasts.</p>
